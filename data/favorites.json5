The average office space in the United States strives towards silence. In the office, music is not a communal experience. It is individually accessed through headphones—sometimes clandestinely via a single earbud—to prevent disturbing one’s coworker in the adjacent cubicle or down the hall. The song playing is a private, often secret, soundtrack to data entry and grant proposals, emails back to one’s boss and surfing the web on company time. The office soundtrack is usually unspoken, hidden in the shadows of business as usual."

As early as seven years old I was robbed of sleep by fears that Katia, whom I thought to be the girl I was destined to marry, hated me. At ten, my qualms turned from romantic to the mystical-academic: I feared that when I awoke all my knowledge of multiplication and division would be erased from my brain and, as a result, I’d be held back a year. Then, in early adolescence, my father lost his job at the ad agency and, although my mother herself had a good job, I was afraid we’d end up in a homeless shelter where I would inevitably be sexually assaulted. (Over dinner one night, my parents and I had watched a long news piece about the epidemic of sexual crimes in homeless shelters.)"

There was no entrance to the forest. I assumed the dot would represent a place in the world that welcomed us. A visitor center. A park with trails. An archway between the trees. There was a sign in front of a dense section of woods that said, “Welcome to the Croatan National Forest,” but there was no way for us to get inside the forest. There were narrow dirt roads with chains across them. There were lone generators imprisoned in chain link fences. We drove until we found a gas station. We asked for directions. The person behind the counter didn’t know what the Croatan National Forest was. We drove to a different gas station. That person didn’t know either.

An ethical dilemma constrains my movement and engulfs me in inaction. When I first entered the bathroom, the toilet seat was already up (making it convenient for me, as I only needed to pee), but since this is an all-inclusive bathroom, with the worldwide data suggesting that there is a little over 50% chance that the next user of the bathroom will be someone who sits to urinate, I don’t know if I should leave the toilet seat as is. If this were a bathroom marked “penis only,” I would not even consider putting the seat down as the rate of public-standing-penis-having-pissers significantly outweighs the number of public-sitting-penis-having-pissers and public-sitting-penis-having-poopers, by a wide margin. However, this is one of those shared, one seater restrooms, that’s all inclusive along the gender spectrum, which, as resident of North Carolina—the state of the bathroom bill fiasco—is definitely a good thing on the macro level, but on a micro level raises more questions like this one."

It’s the most arid desert in the US, full of tiny, ground-hugging plants and creatures, and a relentless dry wind. Moving here required a new practice of observation and a thicker skin."

I can hear him skittering around in my skull when I wake, anxiety-ridden at 3 am, worried about an email I didn't send, the balance in my checking account, my inevitable loneliness, or whether my wife still exists. Sometimes I'm so far away I don't believe she is even real until I reach a hand out in the night to touch her, pushing through the veil of distance between us, letting my palm cup the round pajama-covered curves of her bottom. Some days this is as close as we will get. Some days it is all I need. Other days I never bridge the gap. \n\

I would make a terrible Buddhist. I don't know how to turn off the voices. I am made of desire. I need you to understand this. And some nights, I don't know if the mouse in the ceiling is real or simply a manifestation of my generalized anxiety."

And if you move elsewhere, say, a place that is technically the desert with far less than ten inches of rain per year, where there is rarely a puff in the sky, and for nearly half the year it is 100 degrees, then you have lost your sadness which is a terrible thing to lose. Truly displaced you are, rootless, and with little reference for your interior life, you can close your blinds, blanket up the windows, but the light will seep in trumpet-blaring from pre-dawn to the last possible blast before the sun godfully goes down."

I have to choose what I put down on the page carefully, how the words roll off the tongue, how they mesh with their environment to create cohesive thoughts and sentences that drive forward the story towards its grand or garish denouement. The decision between brief and attaché or serene and halcyon lies only in the moment.

about is how they don’t drink anymore. It’s boring. Th e only time they tell \n\
the good stories is when they get together in secret meetings held in the \n\
church basement. Sometimes I go to these meetings. Th ey’re for members \n\
only. I joined for the activities. \n\
“Hi, my name is Leah, and I’m an alcoholic,” I say to an audience sitting in a semi- circle of folding chairs. “It has been twenty- six hours since \n\
my last drink.” I don’t want to lie. I used to lie a lot as a kid. I try not to do \n\
it as much anymore. \n\
Th e group looks at me with disappointed eyes. \n\
“It’s okay,” says Mark. I get that a lot. \n\
Yesterday, I was invited out for drinks aft er work. I’m only the receptionist so it was a pity invite. I had one beer and left."

us to his wedding. It’s true that he got married in a quickie civil ceremony \n\

even a kid who had no interest in ceremonies, would invite his own parents to his wedding. Or marriage ceremony, or whatever you want to call \n\
it when you’re too precise, too dry, which is Drew all the way. He didn’t \n\
invite friends either, and I know he has a few. We were permitted to join \n\
him for what passed for a reception: just the four of us, an ordinary dinner at an ordinary restaurant that I knew we wouldn’t even remember the \n\
next week, let alone in our rapidly- approaching old age. And it was the \n\
fi rst time we’d met Alison, his bride. Let me tell you, she seemed a little \n\

Ernest and Bill. Gertrude’s stories were usually letters cut out of magazines that looked like ransom notes. Ray’s pages were covered in cigarette \n\
ash, coff ee rings and grease blots. No one wrote better than Flannery and \n\
we all knew this. Bill favored linen suits, Ernest safari gear, and Ray liked \n\
polyester blends that looked like they were from Goodwill. \n\
Aft er class Flannery would stagger past me in her crutches. One night \n\
Ray had to excuse himself amid a coughing fi t. I asked him if he was going to be all right. He nodded, holding a bloody handkerchief over his \n\
mouth. Ernest usually woke up Bill when it was time to leave and together \n\
they would stagger out into the night leaning on each other for support. \n\
At the end of every class I’d fall asleep. When I woke up next, the class \n\
would be peering out at me, as if I’d been drooling on myself in my sleep."

The upholstery on the armchair, also in a shade of gray, needs a deep cleaning. The desk and dresser have the usual signs of wear—scratches, dings, and watermarks. The shower is nice, though. I adjust the water temperature. The white subway-tiled floor and walls of the shower are clean. The showerhead is massive and produces a high-pressure rainfall that I know I can lose time under, so I focus on the tasks at hand—wash and rinse, and rinse a little more. "

Ads that sell products die a quick death. Ads that expose their products’ souls are refined, elevated, polished to a blinding sheen, and unleashed upon the world, where they reveal deep truths, transform the global conversation, and so on. \n\

Really, nothing distinguishes the first floor from the offices of any generic advertising firm. Similar work has been done better and worse. Occasionally, the corporation’s street team devises pranks that go viral. More often, adblockers consign their five-second videos to oblivion."

They’d been living in the comfort that I was, and always would be, a loser. That was my righteous path. I was to make no real money, achieve no notoriety, and then die before them. "

which is why my name Adi seems unusual to me. It means \"the first\" but I'm certain my parents gave \n\
it to me as a consolation for being the last. \n\
I live in a small city now and, just like when I was younger, I'm surrounded by lots of people, \n\
movement, and change. It all keeps me from being buried in an avalanche of thoughts about myself. \n\
At the moment, I'm sitting on one of the chairs made available for people waiting at the front of \n\
a large store I visit once a week. Kids also wait here for their parents to checkout. Others wait for a \n\
taxi or a bus, especially when it's snowing like it is today. I'm waiting for something to pop into my \n\
head that's just not getting there."

Probably not the truth, that my favorite color is pink. I remember the outfit I wore. I put on fake tortoise shell rimmed glasses and a loose button up blouse. My face was bare with only a flash of mascara, just enough to show that I cared. I wore whatever would confuse the shape of my body. I knew even then, that no one wants a nanny to also be a woman. "

Trouble hangs above us, ready to crush us all. That might explain why there’s few pedestrians on this street.

Their stares explore my passing face. They don’t call out to me. \n\

Walking along Christopher, his eyes did not dart, as ours darted, to the periphery at every block and corner to see who he might see and who might see him.

 \n\
They remember teletype machines and Christmas parties with booze, held right here in the office, with the director’s blessing. One year, the office held a slave auction to raise money for charity. It was all in good fun. The slaves had to do things like take their new masters shopping for cute clothes, or make them coffee in the morning. \n\
 \n\
They judge celebrity diets, political policy, the barista's new hairstyle. They judge strangers and friends. Only their own children are off limits. One sometimes talks about the other’s children but whispered, behind a hand. The office ladies observe their own rules."

The tattoo on his shoulder is of a scorpion with a can of Coors in one of its pincers. Everyone is pushing forward, but there is no forward. Security guards in blue shirts lift girls in hemp halter-tops over the rail. Their faces are red, their limbs floppy and useless. I’m so thirsty I consider licking the sweat off the back of the scorpion man. Alice in Chains hasn’t even taken the stage yet. Everything smells like marijuana. Joe can’t take it. He climbs onto the shoulders of the guy in front of him, is immediately flung into the air. He extends his arms. For a few seconds he is Christ floating on a river of hands. They deposit him to the security guards, who give him bottled water and send him to the First Aid tent. I think one of my ribs is broken."

interminable wars that the French were always fighting, \n\
and he doesn’t return until eight years later. Boy, \n\
